                        <p>I got a letter this morning, how do you reckon it read? <br />
                        Said, "Hurry, hurry! The gal you love is dead." <br />
                        I got a letter this morning, I say how you reckon its read? <br />
                        It say, "Hurry, hurry! Because the gal you love is dead." <br /> <br />

                        You know I grabbed up my suitcase, took off down the road <br />
                        When I got there, she was laying on the cooling board <br />
                        I said I grabbed up my suitcase, I said I took off down the road <br />
                        I said when I got there, she was laying on the cooling board <br /> <br />

                        You know, I walked up close, looked down in her face <br />
                        She's a good old gal, and today had her Judgment Day <br />
                         I walked up close, I said I looked down in her face <br />
                        I say she's a good old girl and today had her Judgment Day <br /> <br />

                        Looked like it was 10,000 people <br />
                        Were standin' around the buryin' ground <br />
                        I didn't know I loved her, until I began to let her down <br />
                        Looked like it was 10,000 standin' around the buryin' ground <br />
                        You know I didn't know that I loved her <br />
                        Until I began to let her down <br /> <br />

                        Well, I hold up my arms, I slowly walked away <br />
                        I said, "Farewell honey, I'll see you in Judgement Day." <br />
                        I hold up my arms, and I slowly walked away <br />
                        I said, "Farewell, farewell, I'll see you in Judgement Day." <br /> <br />

                        Well, I went in my room, I bowed to pray <br /> 
                        The blues came along and drove my spirit away <br />
                        I said I went in my room and I bowed down to pray <br />
                        I said when the blues came along and drove my spirit away <br /> <br />

                        Well, Lord have mercy on my weakened soul <br />
                        I won't mistreat nobody not for my weight in gold <br />
                        I said Lord have mercy on my weakened soul <br />
                        I said I won't mistreat nobody not for my weight in gold</p> <br />
